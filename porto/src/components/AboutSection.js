          Iâ€™m a web developer and graphic designer with a passion for
          technology. I focus my time between design and code while working on
          awesome projects. Currently my skillset has me focused mainly on
          front-end development, but I'm ready to tackle any challenge. <br />
          <br />
          On my personal time I love traveling and playing video games.
